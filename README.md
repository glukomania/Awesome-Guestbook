This is a test task for "Awesome Developers UG" made using React, Typescript and MUI.

**Note:** It seems to me that there is one extra checkbox in the table header on the mockup. If it's not a mistake, then it's not entirely clear how it's supposed to work. I assumed that it was an error, so I didn't display or handle it.


**npm start** - runs the app.
**npm tests** - lunches tests.
